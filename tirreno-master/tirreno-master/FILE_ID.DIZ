   888  his is the 
    8   beginning 
    8   of a new day.

   God has given 
   me this day to 
   use as I will.

   I can waste it
   or use it for good

   What I do today
   is very important
   because I am
   exchanging a day
   of my life for it.

   When tomorrow
   comes, this day
   will be gone
   forever, leaving
   something in its
   place I have
   traded for it

   I want it to be
   gain, not loss...
   Good, not evil...
   Success, not failure...
   In order that I shall
   not forget the
   price I paid for it.
